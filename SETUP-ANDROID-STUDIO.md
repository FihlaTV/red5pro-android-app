### Red5 Pro Server
The __Red5 Pro__ is build on the Open Source [Red5 Server](https://github.com/Red5/red5-server) and allows to build scalable live streaming and second screen applications.

The example application provided in this project repository integrates the Red5 Pro Native SDKs  and libraries that enable live streaming and second screen experiences. You will need to setup a Red5 Pro server - either on your local machine or remotely - in order to stream video and communicate with a second screen host.

More information about Red5 Pro, its SDKs and setup can be found in the online [Red5 Pro Documentation](http://red5pro.com/docs/).
